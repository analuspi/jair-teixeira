            <h1>Bio</h1>
            <p>Bachelor and Master in Music by the University of Campinas (SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil) and the Doctorate in Music (Performance - Jazz) 
                by Laval University in Quebec City. I hold nearly 20 years of experience in the concert music (classical) as well as in the 
                popular music (Jazz, Brazilian music, Latin music, etc.) and also in the technological field (recording, production and mixing). 
                My experiences have allowed me to develop a solid artistic career based, mainly, on the performance of big ensembles like Big Band, 
                Wind Orchestra and Symphony Orchestra. I'm recognized by the good direction of the saxophones section, the good technique, the good 
                sound and the domain of the four most famous saxophones as well the flute.</p>
